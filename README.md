# p5-Sketch-to-Code - A Minimalist Drawing Tool for p5.js Enthusiasts

This tool lets you create sketches and effortlessly convert them into p5.js code. While it's still a work in progress and lacks many standard drawing app features, it's my first attempt at building such an application. Your valuable contributions and feedback are highly welcome to help make it better!

## Inspiration

I got so frustrated manually drawing shapes with p5 code for my university homework that I decided to make life easier! Sure, creating this app takes 100x more time than just doing the homework, but it's way more fun to make the computer do it for us.
